##Development

The requirements for this project are node.js and grunt. 

To install node with Hombrew:
`brew install node`

Otherwise head over to the [Node website](http://nodejs.org/) and install from there.

##Data Tools
To use the Python data tools included in this project, first set up your local Python environment, and then `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

These scripts are all expecting json data in a specific format.
`geojson-converter.py` converts said data into a single geojson file.
`data-splitter.py` converts said data into state-by-state json files that can be ingested into the front-end app.
